Planned improvements:
  # ~~Remove any dependency on TestNG or JUnit, just throw AssertionError~~ - Done in 0.1.0
  # Superclasses - Use reflection to move up the class heirarchy
  # Primitive arrays
  # ~~Objects (Programmable?)~~ - Done in 0.2.0
  # Reporting 
  # Site documentation
  # Optional failure for bad hashCode implementation
  # Transient fields
  # Add a test against null object (sometimes the unequalObject should be null, maybe the exampleX object should automatically be null?  Or make multiple unequalObjects programmable, so they can test non-equal classes as well?)
  # mvn assembly for source as well?
