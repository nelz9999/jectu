# Projects with similar aims as JECTU #
  * [JUnit-Addons](http://junit-addons.sourceforge.net/) - A Pre-JUnit4 base class, called `EqualsHashCodeTestCase`
  * [Unitils](http://www.unitils.org/) - A newly released 1.0 project that focuses on testing persistent objects, including a reflection-based equals tester.  (I'll be looking into this project for possible synergies...)
